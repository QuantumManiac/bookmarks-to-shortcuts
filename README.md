# bookmarks-to-shortcuts
Mirrors Chrome bookmarks to your local filesystem, replicating the directory structure and converting bookmarks into internet shortcuts.

## Usage

This script takes the Bookmarks file that Chromium-based browsers use to store bookmarks as the input. Typically, this file is:
```sh
"%appdata%\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Bookmarks" # Windows
"~/.config/google-chrome/Default/Bookmarks" # Linux
"~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Bookmarks" # MacOS
```
The filepath may vary depending on the user profile that you're not using in the browser (i.e. not Default). Other Chromium-based browsers should store their bookmarks in a similar location.

As for usage of the script itself:
```
‚ùØ python main.py -h
usage: main.py [-h] [-o OUTPUT] input
